# Polygon-Labeler
Polygon Labeler is a QGIS plugin that automates polygon labeling. It generates custom labels based on unique IDs or logic, adds them as a new field in the attribute table, and dynamically applies them to the map. Ideal for zoning, vulnerability analyses, or any GIS project, it enhances visualization, streamlines workflows, and saves time.
